                    <p>College education demands not just dedication but also smart approaches to learning. Claude offers powerful ways to enhance your study process, deepen understanding, and manage your academic workload efficiently. This guide shows you how to leverage AI as a personal learning assistant without using it as a shortcut that might undermine your education.</p>

                <div class="guide-section">
                    <h2>AI as a Learning Lever, Not a Crutch</h2>
                    <p>Before diving into specific techniques, it's important to establish a healthy approach to using AI in your studies:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Use AI to enhance understanding</strong>, not to bypass the learning process</li>
                        <li><strong>Leverage AI for organization and connections</strong> between concepts you're already studying</li>
                        <li><strong>See AI as a conversation partner</strong> to deepen your engagement with material</li>
                        <li><strong>Remember that learning happens through struggle</strong> - let AI help you overcome obstacles, not avoid them entirely</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The goal is to use Claude as a catalyst for deeper learning while still developing your own critical thinking skills and knowledge base.</p>
